      "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\n",
      "bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\n",
      "the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\n",
      "conversations in it, âand what is the use of a book,â thought Alice\n",
      "âwithout pictures or conversations?â\n",
      "\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\n",
      "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\n",
      "so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, âOh\n",
      "dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!â (when she thought it over afterwards,\n",
      "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\n",
      "time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\n",
      "watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\n",
      "on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\n",
      "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\n",
      "watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n",
      "field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\n",
      "large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\n",
      "deep well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\n",
      "was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\n",
      "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\n",
      "passed; it was labelled âORANGE MARMALADEâ, but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\n",
      "cupboards as she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell!â thought Alice to herself, âafter such a fall as this, I shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâll all think me\n",
      "at home! Why, I wouldnât say anything about it, even if I fell off the\n",
      "top of the house!â (Which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? âI wonder how\n",
      "many miles Iâve fallen by this time?â she said aloud. âI must be\n",
      "getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\n",
      "be four thousand miles down, I thinkââ (for, you see, Alice had learnt\n",
      "several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\n",
      "though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\n",
      "knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\n",
      "practice to say it over) ââyes, thatâs about the right distanceâbut\n",
      "then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Iâve got to?â (Alice had no\n",
      "idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\n",
      "grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began again. âI wonder if I shall fall right _through_\n",
      "the earth! How funny itâll seem to come out among the people that walk\n",
      "with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkââ (she was rather\n",
      "glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnât sound at all\n",
      "the right word) ââbut I shall have to ask them what the name of the\n",
      "country is, you know. Please, Maâam, is this New Zealand or Australia?â\n",
      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâfancy _curtseying_ as youâre\n",
      "falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) âAnd what\n",
      "an ignorant little girl sheâll think me for asking! No, itâll never do\n",
      "to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n",
      "talking again. âDinahâll miss me very much to-night, I should think!â\n",
      "(Dinah was the cat.) âI hope theyâll remember her saucer of milk at\n",
      "tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\n",
      "no mice in the air, Iâm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâs\n",
      "very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?â And here\n",
      "Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\n",
      "dreamy sort of way, âDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?â and\n",
      "sometimes, âDo bats eat cats?â for, you see, as she couldnât answer\n",
      "either question, it didnât much matter which way she put it. She felt\n",
      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\n",
      "walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n",
      "âNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?â when suddenly,\n",
      "thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\n",
      "the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\n",
      "she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\n",
      "long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\n",
      "it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\n",
      "and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, âOh my ears\n",
      "and whiskers, how late itâs getting!â She was close behind it when she\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n",
      "from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",
      "Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n",
      "door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\n",
      "get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Aliceâs\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\n",
      "passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\n",
      "out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\n",
      "flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\n",
      "through the doorway; âand even if my head would go through,â thought\n",
      "poor Alice, âit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\n",
      "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\n",
      "knew how to begin.â For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\n",
      "happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\n",
      "indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, (âwhich certainly was not here\n",
      "before,â said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",
      "label, with the words âDRINK ME,â beautifully printed on it in large\n",
      "letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very well to say âDrink me,â but the wise little Alice was\n",

      "âand see whether itâs marked â_poison_â or notâ; for she had read\n",
      "several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\n",
      "eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n",

      "ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?â Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\n",
      "gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\n",
      "they were nowhere to be seenâeverything seemed to have changed since\n",

      "doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\n",
      "a fan! Quick, now!â And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\n",

      "mistake it had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe took me for his housemaid,â she said to herself as she ran. âHow\n",

      "his fan and glovesâthat is, if I can find them.â As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name âW. RABBIT,â engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",

      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow queer it seems,â Alice said to herself, âto be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinahâll be sending me on messages next!â And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: ââMiss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!â âComing in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But Iâve got to see that the mouse doesnât get out.â Only I\n",

      "\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\n",
      "pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\n",
      "gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\n",
      "little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\n",
      "this time with the words âDRINK ME,â but nevertheless she uncorked it\n",
      "and put it to her lips. âI know _something_ interesting is sure to\n",
      "happen,â she said to herself, âwhenever I eat or drink anything; so\n",
      "Iâll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itâll make me grow large\n",
      "again, for really Iâm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!â\n",
      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",
      "and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\n",
      "down the bottle, saying to herself âThatâs quite enoughâI hope I shanât\n",
      "grow any moreâAs it is, I canât get out at the doorâI do wish I hadnât\n",
      "drunk quite so much!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself âNow I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt was much pleasanter at home,â thought poor Alice, âwhen one wasnât\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadnât gone down that rabbit-holeâand yetâand\n",
      "yetâitâs rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\n",
      "that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\n",
      "one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\n",
      "when I grow up, Iâll write oneâbut Iâm grown up now,â she added in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone; âat least thereâs no room to grow up any more _here_.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut then,â thought Alice, âshall I _never_ get any older than I am\n",
      "now? Thatâll be a comfort, one wayânever to be an old womanâbut\n",
      "thenâalways to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnât like _that!_â\n",

      "for any lesson-books!â\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\n",
      "making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\n",
      "she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMary Ann! Mary Ann!â said the voice. âFetch me my gloves this moment!â\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\n",
      "large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",

      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself âThen Iâll\n",

      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",

      "for apples, yer honour!â\n",
      "\n",

      "all!â âDo as I tell you, you coward!â and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. âWhat a number\n",
      "of cucumber-frames there must be!â thought Alice. âI wonder what\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, âI\n",

      "roof off.â After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, âA barrowful will do, to begin with.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âA barrowful of _what?_â thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. âIâll put a stop to\n",
      "this,â she said to herself, and shouted out, âYouâd better not do that\n",
      "again!â which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. âIf I eat one of these cakes,â she thought, âitâs sure to make\n",
      "_some_ change in my size; and as it canât possibly make me larger, it\n",
      "must make me smaller, I suppose.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\n",
      "through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\n",
      "little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\n",
      "was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe first thing Iâve got to do,â said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, âis to grow to my right size again; and the\n",

      "will be the best plan.â\n",

      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",

      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. âPoor little\n",
      "thing!â said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\n",
      "it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\n",
      "might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\n",
      "spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\n",
      "and till the puppyâs bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!â said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: âI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifâif Iâd\n",

      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",

      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",

      "\n",
      "âWho are _you?_â said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, âIâI hardly know, sir, just at presentâat least I know\n",

      "\n",
      "âI donât see,â said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâm afraid I canât put it more clearly,â Alice replied very politely,\n",
      "âfor I canât understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt isnât,â said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, perhaps you havenât found it so yet,â said Alice; âbut when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalisâyou will some day, you knowâand then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, I should think youâll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, wonât you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNot a bit,â said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,â said Alice; âall I know\n",
      "is, it would feel very queer to _me_.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou!â said the Caterpillar contemptuously. âWho are _you?_â\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillarâs making such _very_\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, âI\n",
      "think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy?â said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome back!â the Caterpillar called after her. âIâve something\n",
      "important to say!â\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n",

      "âKeep your temper,â said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "could.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\n",
      "and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\n",
      "some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\n",
      "its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, âSo you\n",
      "think youâre changed, do you?â\n",

      "\n",
      "âCanât remember _what_ things?â said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "âRepeat, â_You are old, Father William_,ââ said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "\n",

      "words have got altered.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is wrong from beginning to end,â said the Caterpillar decidedly,\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh, Iâm not particular as to size,â Alice hastily replied; âonly one\n",
      "doesnât like changing so often, you know.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI _donât_ know,â said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\n",
      "before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAre you content now?â said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnât\n",
      "mind,â said Alice: âthree inches is such a wretched height to be.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is a very good height indeed!â said the Caterpillar angrily,\n",
      "rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut Iâm not used to it!â pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\n",
      "thought of herself, âI wish the creatures wouldnât be so easily\n",
      "offended!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYouâll get used to it in time,â said the Caterpillar; and it put the\n",
      "hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\n",
      "minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\n",
      "yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\n",
      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",
      "âOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\n",
      "grow shorter.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_â thought Alice to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf the mushroom,â said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\n",
      "aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\n",
      "trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\n",
      "perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\n",
      "last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\n",
      "off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd now which is which?â she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\n",
      "violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",
      "lefthand bit.\n",

      "changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\n",
      "were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\n",
      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\n",

      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\n",
      "she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\n",
      "her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\n",
      "had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\n",
      "going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\n",
      "the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\n",
      "hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\n",

      "\n",

      "are; secondly, because theyâre making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.â And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\n",
      "noise going on withinâa constant howling and sneezing, and every now\n",
      "and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âThere might be some sense in your knocking,â the Footman went on\n",

      "this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. âBut perhaps he canât help it,â\n",

      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footmanâs head: it just grazed his nose,\n",

      "\n",
      "ââor next day, maybe,â the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",

      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the babyâthe fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, _please_ mind what youâre doing!â cried Alice, jumping up and down\n",
      "in an agony of terror. âOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!â as an\n",
      "unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf everybody minded their own business,â the Duchess said in a hoarse\n",

      "\n",
      "âWhich would _not_ be an advantage,â said Alice, who felt very glad to\n",

      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh, donât bother _me_,â said the Duchess; âI never could abide\n",

      "not like the look of the thing at all. âBut perhaps it was only\n",
      "sobbing,â she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\n",
      "were any tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there were no tears. âIf youâre going to turn into a pig, my dear,â\n",

      "now!â The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, âNow, what am I to do\n",

      "there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\n",

      "further.\n",
      "\n",

      "rather a handsome pig, I think.â And she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, âif one only knew the right way to change themââ when she\n",

      "cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. âVery\n",

      "writing-desks, which wasnât much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. âWhat day of the month\n",

      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said âThe fourth.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âTwo days wrong!â sighed the Hatter. âI told you butter wouldnât suit\n",

      "\n",
      "âAh! that accounts for it,â said the Hatter. âHe wonât stand beating.\n",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, heâd do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oâclock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: youâd only have to whisper a\n",
      "hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\n",
      "time for dinner!â\n",
      "\n",
      "(âI only wish it was,â the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat would be grand, certainly,â said Alice thoughtfully: âbut thenâI\n",

      "âNot at first, perhaps,â said the Hatter: âbut you could keep it to\n",

      "with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) ââit was at the great concert\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âWell, Iâd hardly finished the first verse,â said the Hatter, âwhen the\n",

      "\n",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. âI wasnât asleep,â he said in a\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",

      "âIâll tell it her,â said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: âsit\n",
      "down, both of you, and donât speak a word till Iâve finished.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, âI donât see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesnât begin.â\n",
      "But she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",

      "Turtle.â\n",
      "\n",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of âHjckrrh!â from the Gryphon, and the constant\n",

      "saying, âThank you, sir, for your interesting story,â but she could not\n",

      "Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, âDrive on, old fellow! Donât be all\n",
